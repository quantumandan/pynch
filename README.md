Pynch
=====

A pythonic ORM built on top of pymongo, drawing heavily from Mongoengine's interface, while improving the implementation when and where possible.


*** "Easy to use in a pinch" ***
--------------------------------
* Familiar -- if you can use Django's ORM or SqlAlchemy, you can use Pynch easily
* JSON serialization/deserialization "just works"
* Subclassing of wrapper types
* Rebuilt for Python 3
* Support for compound and other exotic primary key types
